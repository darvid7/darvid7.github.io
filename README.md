# My Website
Hi ðŸ‘‹so this isn't my actual website because user github pages only serves from the repository i.e. you can't point to a docs/dist/build folder.

However project pages allow you to serve your content form `docs/`. So I have a project called `notdavid.me` that is hosted on `https://darvid7.github.io/notdavid.me/` which I redirect to `www.notdavid.me` (my domain) yay ðŸŽ‰
