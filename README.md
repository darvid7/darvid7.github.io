# My Website
Work in progress.......(like me irl)...

So this isn't my actual website because user github pages only serves from the repository i.e. you can't point to a docs/dist/build folder.

However project pages allow you to serve your content form `docs/`. So I have a project called me.

That is hosted https://darvid7.github.io/notdavid.me/ which I redirect to www.notdavid.me (my domain).

Built using hugo & HTML5up.
