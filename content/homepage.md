Hi 👋I'm David, born, raised in Melbourne Australia 🇦🇺, the most livable city on Earth 🌏I study Software Engineering at Monash University 🎓and work a bit there, you can read more about my [work experience here](/resume). In my spare time I travel ✈️, look for dogs to pet 🐶, eat food ☕️🍕🍣 , binge watch Netflix shows 📺and find cool side [projects](/projects) to work on 💻. 

I've been fortunate enough to visit 🇲🇾🇸🇬🇫🇯🇮🇹🇬🇧🇺🇸🇦🇪🇫🇷and will soon be adding 🇯🇵🇹🇼to the list!

Thanks for checking out my website!

I'm always open to new ideas and projects, I also freelance sometimes, feel free to get in contact.
