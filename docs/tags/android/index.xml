      <description>Over the past summer (2017 - 2018) I worked on the Google Maps Location Sharing team! Location Sharing in Maps allows you to share your location with someone.

I worked on two features to improve the user experience when sharing location by providing more information to the person being shared with, I can now talk about because they launched!</description>
